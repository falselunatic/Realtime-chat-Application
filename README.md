## Importants

* Install XAMPP server on your desktop.
* Start both of these modules "Apache" & "MySQL".
* Then click on the "Admin" button in the MySQL module.
* Next, The tab of "PhpMyAdmin" will be opened on your desktop.  
* Now, Create DataBase `chat`.
* In this DB, we will be creating two tables, named as `messages` & `users`.
---
* So, at first, ```create table messages which will be having 4 columns named as `msg_id` (int(11)),`incoming_msg_id` (int(255)), `outgoing_msg_id` (int(255)), `msg` (varchar(1000)).```
---
* ```now, create another table `users` in which details of users will be getting stored.
 this table will be having 8 coulms named as `user_id` (int(11)), `unique_id` (int(255)), `fname` (varchar(255)), `lname` (varchar(255)), `email` (varchar(255)), `password` (varchar(255)), `img` (varchar(255)), `status` (varchar(255)).```
